# ✅ All URL Issues FIXED

## What Was Fixed

### 🔴 Critical Backend Route Conflicts (FIXED)

#### 1. Job Routes - Route Order Fixed
**File:** `backend/src/routes/job.routes.ts`

**Problem:** Dynamic route `/:jobId` was catching all requests before specific routes could be reached.

**Before:**
```typescript
router.get('/:jobId', ...)           // Caught everything
router.get('/public/:jobId', ...)    // Never reached ❌
router.post('/ai/generate-description', ...) // Never reached ❌
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Specific routes FIRST
router.get('/public/:jobId', ...)    // ✅ Now works
router.post('/ai/generate-description', ...) // ✅ Now works

// Dynamic routes LAST  
router.get('/:jobId', ...)           // ✅ Still works, but only for actual job IDs
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Public job application page now works
- ✅ AI job description generation now works
- ✅ Regular job fetching still works

---

#### 2. Candidate Routes - Route Order Fixed
**File:** `backend/src/routes/candidate.routes.ts`

**Problem:** Dynamic route `/:candidateId` was catching dashboard stats request.

**Before:**
```typescript
router.get('/:candidateId', ...)        // Caught "dashboard" as ID
router.get('/dashboard/stats', ...)     // Never reached ❌
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Specific routes FIRST
router.get('/dashboard/stats', ...)     // ✅ Now works

// Dynamic routes LAST
router.get('/:candidateId', ...)        // ✅ Still works
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Dashboard statistics now load correctly
- ✅ Shows actual job/candidate/interview counts
- ✅ Individual candidate fetching still works

---

### 🟡 Frontend Missing Pages (FIXED)

#### 3. Dashboard "Create New Job" Link Fixed
**File:** `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<Link href="/dashboard/jobs/new">  // ❌ 404 Not Found
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Link href="/dashboard/jobs">      // ✅ Goes to jobs page with create modal
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ "Create New Job Post" button now works
- ✅ Opens jobs page where user can click "Create Job" modal
- ✅ No duplicate create pages needed

---

#### 4. Forgot Password Page Created
**File:** `frontend/src/app/forgot-password/page.tsx` (NEW)

**Features:**
- ✅ Email input with validation
- ✅ Firebase password reset email integration
- ✅ Success confirmation screen
- ✅ Error handling for invalid emails, user not found, rate limiting
- ✅ Link back to login page

**Impact:**
- ✅ "Forgot Password?" link on login page now works
- ✅ Users can reset passwords via email
