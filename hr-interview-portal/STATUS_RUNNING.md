## 🔑 Key Changes Made

### Configuration Updates
- ✅ Backend `server.ts`: Changed to listen on `0.0.0.0`
- ✅ Backend `app.ts`: Added IP to CORS whitelist
- ✅ Backend `.env`: URLs updated to use IP address
- ✅ Frontend `.env.local`: Created with IP-based API URL
- ✅ Frontend `candidates/page.tsx`: Fixed Suspense boundary

### Dependencies Added
- ✅ `fs-extra` - For local file operations
- ✅ `@types/fs-extra` - TypeScript definitions

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Local resume storage (no Firebase Storage costs)
- ✅ Resume download endpoint (`/api/candidates/resume/:jobId/:fileName`)
- ✅ Network access from other devices
- ✅ Graceful error handling

## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. Create a Job Posting
- Go to http://192.168.0.141:3000
- Sign up or login
- Create a new job posting
- Note the Job ID from URL

### 2. Apply from Mobile/Other Device
- On other device: http://192.168.0.141:3000/apply/[jobId]
- Fill in candidate details
- Upload a PDF/DOC resume
- Submit application

### 3. View Resumes on Dashboard
- Go back to HR dashboard
- View candidates for the job
- Click "View Resume" to download
- Resumes stored in `backend/storage/resumes/`

### 4. Test Features
- Email sending (if configured)
- Fire base authentication
- Candidate management
- AI-powered features

## 💾 File Storage

All uploaded resumes are stored locally at:
```
backend/storage/resumes/
├── {jobId}/
│   ├── {timestamp}_{filename}.pdf
│   └── {timestamp}_{filename}.docx
```

These files are:
- ✅ Excluded from Git (in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Accessible via API endpoint
- ✅ Downloaded to your laptop's disk
- ✅ Persisted between restarts

## 🆘 If Something Isn't Working

### Backend not accessible from other device
1. Check your IP: `ipconfig | Select-String "IPv4"`
2. Verify firewall isn't blocking ports 3000/5000
3. Restart services: Press `Ctrl+C` and run again
4. Check backend is listening: `netstat -ano | findstr :5000`

### Frontend not loading
1. Check frontend is running: See terminal 2
2. Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
3. Try incognito mode
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Resume uploads failing
1. Verify `backend/storage/resumes/` exists
2. Check file size < 5MB
3. Use PDF, DOC, or DOCX format
4. Look at backend console for errors

### API calls returning 404
1. Check `.env.local` has correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
2. Verify backend is running
3. Check network connectivity between machines
4. Try from same machine first: `localhost:3000`
