## What Works Without External APIs

You can deploy and use the app WITHOUT these optional services:

- ❌ No OpenRouter API? → Manual job creation still works
- ❌ No Email setup? → App works, just no email notifications
- ❌ No BeyondPresence? → Use any other video interview platform
- ❌ No n8n? → Manual workflow, app still functional

**Core Features Work With Just:**
- ✅ Firebase (Free tier)
- ✅ Backend hosting (Free tier)
- ✅ Frontend on Vercel (Already done)

---

## Testing After Deployment

```bash
curl https://your-backend.railway.app/api/health
```
Expected: `{"success":true,"message":"API is running"}`

### 2. Frontend
Open: `https://your-app.vercel.app`

### 3. Complete Flow
- [ ] Sign up / Login works
- [ ] Create job works
- [ ] AI generation works (if API key set)
- [ ] Copy application link
- [ ] Open in incognito
- [ ] Submit application works
