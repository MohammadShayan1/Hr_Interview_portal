# Pages Added - Summary

## ✅ Successfully Created Missing Pages

I've created all three missing dashboard pages that were causing 404 errors:

### 1. Jobs Page (`/dashboard/jobs`)
**Location**: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/jobs/page.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ View all job postings in a list
- ✅ Create new job postings manually
- ✅ Generate job descriptions with AI (using OpenRouter.ai)
- ✅ Edit existing jobs
- ✅ Delete jobs with confirmation
- ✅ View candidates for each job
- ✅ Copy application links
- ✅ Beautiful modal dialogs for create/edit
- ✅ AI generation modal with purple theme
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Responsive design

### 2. Candidates Page (`/dashboard/candidates`)
**Location**: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/candidates/page.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Filter candidates by job posting
- ✅ View all candidate applications
- ✅ Display candidate details (name, email, phone, experience)
- ✅ Show application status with color-coded badges
- ✅ View/download resumes
- ✅ Access interview links
- ✅ View AI evaluation reports in modal
- ✅ Report shows score, recommendation, summary, strengths, weaknesses
- ✅ Empty states for no jobs/candidates
- ✅ Responsive grid layout

### 3. Settings Page (`/dashboard/settings`)
**Location**: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Profile settings (display name, email)
- ✅ Notification preferences with toggles:
  - Email notifications
  - New candidate applications
  - Interview completed
  - Weekly digest
- ✅ Security section (password reset placeholder)
- ✅ Account information display:
  - User ID
  - Account created date
  - Last sign-in date
- ✅ Save buttons for each section
- ✅ Beautiful toggle switches
- ✅ Organized with icons

## 🎨 Design Features

All pages include:
- Protected routes (require authentication)
- DashboardLayout wrapper (sidebar navigation)
- Consistent UI with Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React icons
- Toast notifications (success/error/info)
- Loading states with spinners
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Hover effects and transitions
- Responsive design

## 🔧 Technical Details

**Fixed Issues**:
1. ✅ API call signature for job generation (now uses object parameter)
2. ✅ Candidate interface alignment (uses `experience` not `yearsOfExperience`)
3. ✅ Toast notification method (`toast()` instead of `toast.info()`)
4. ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved

**Integration Points**:
- Uses `jobService` for CRUD operations
- Uses `candidateService` for fetching candidates
- Uses `useAuth` context for user data
- Uses Next.js App Router conventions
- Client-side components with `'use client'` directive

## 🚀 How to Access

1. **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5000
2. **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000

**Navigation**:
- Login at http://localhost:3000/login
- After login, use sidebar to access:
  - 📊 Dashboard: `/dashboard`
  - 💼 Jobs: `/dashboard/jobs`
  - 👥 Candidates: `/dashboard/candidates`
  - ⚙️ Settings: `/dashboard/settings`

## 📝 Next Steps

The pages are now ready to use! Try:

1. **Create a job** using manual input or AI generation
2. **Share the application link** with test candidates
3. **View candidates** who apply
4. **Check evaluation reports** after interviews complete
5. **Manage settings** and notification preferences

All pages will hot-reload automatically in development mode. If you don't see them immediately, try refreshing your browser at http://localhost:3000/dashboard/jobs

**Status**: ✅ All pages complete and error-free
